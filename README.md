Developed a straightforward movie recommendation system that suggests films similar to a userâ€™s input. Users enter a movie title, and the system uses cosine similarity to identify the closest match from a dataset. By calculating similarity scores between the input movie and others, the system ranks the movies in descending order of similarity.
