This project is a simple movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on a user's input. The user enters the name of a movie, and the system identifies the closest match from a list of available movies using string matching techniques. Once the best match is found, the system retrieves the index of the movie and calculates the similarity scores with all other movies in the dataset. These scores are then sorted in descending order to find the most similar movies, and the top 15 recommendations are displayed to the user. This approach allows users to discover movies that closely resemble their preferences.
